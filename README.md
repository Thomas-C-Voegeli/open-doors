# README
For a cleaned-up version of this project with nicer forms, Ajax calls for the `Door` model's `create` and `update` actions, updated RSpec, and more code refactoring, see https://github.com/thomas-c-voegeli/open-doors-2

JQuery and Bootstrap are sourced in-line from views/layouts/application.html.erb. Past experience has shown this to give faster load times.
